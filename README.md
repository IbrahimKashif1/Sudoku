# Sudoku
This is a sudoku game which uses a GUI and the back tracking algorithm to allow an individual to solve a sudoku board on either easy, medium or hard.

# How to Play

1) First you have 3 options either you can let the computer generate a random board for you (enter 1), you can create your on board (enter 2), or use the premade board (enter 3).

2) Next if you choose to generate a random board you will be asked the level of difficulty you would like to play on. 
For easy (enter 1), for medium (enter 2), or for hard (enter 3).

3) Click on an empty board and press the number on your keyboard that you think fits in that position. This will pencil in the value on the sudoku board, if you want to test that value press enter.

4) Finally to see the backtracking algorithm work press SPACE and it will show you the implementation of the algorithm.
